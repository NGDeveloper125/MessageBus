# MessageBus-Functional-vs-OOP
Compering Functional and OOP approach In a Message Bus Service
# Microservice Message Bus

This project serves as a comparative exploration of two prominent programming paradigms: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP). The primary focus is on developing a message bus for microservice infrastructure, facilitating seamless communication between services in a generic and straightforward manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C#
- **.NET Version:** 8
- **Socket Library:** NetMQ

## Project Overview

The microservice message bus is designed to showcase and compare the implementation styles of both Object-Oriented and Functional Programming. By utilizing C# with .NET 8 and NetMQ for handling sockets, this project provides a practical demonstration of how these programming paradigms can be applied to the microservices architecture.

## Features

- **Generic Communication:** Enables communication between microservices in a flexible and generic way.
- **OOP and FP Implementation:** Illustrates both Object-Oriented and Functional Programming approaches for the same functionality.

## Getting Started
