# MessageBus

## Functional Message Bus with TDD and DDD

This project aims to develop a generic message bus for microservice infrastructure using a functional programming approach, guided by the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The message bus facilitates efficient and reliable communication between microservices in a clean and maintainable manner.

### Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C#
- .NET Version: 8
- Socket Library: NetMQ
- Testing Framework: xUnit & NSubstitute

## Project Overview

The MessageBus project focuses on creating a robust and scalable message bus that enables seamless communication between microservices. By leveraging functional programming techniques, the codebase is designed to be highly modular, testable, and maintainable. The adoption of TDD ensures that the system is thoroughly tested and reliable, while DDD principles help in creating a domain-centric clean architecture that aligns with the business requirements.

### Key Features

- **Generic Communication:** The message bus provides a generic interface for communication, allowing microservices to exchange messages without tight coupling.
- **Functional Programming:** The codebase is implemented using functional programming principles, emphasizing immutability, pure functions, and composability.
- **Test-Driven Development:** The development process follows a TDD approach, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and enabling confident refactoring.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** The message bus is designed with DDD principles in mind, focusing on the core domain concepts and their interactions.
- **NetMQ Integration:** The project utilizes the NetMQ library for efficient and reliable socket-based communication between microservices.
